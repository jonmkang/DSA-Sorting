1. Understanding merge sort
    21, 1, 26, 45, 29, 28, 2, 9, 16, 49, 39, 27, 43, 34, 46, 40

    What is the resulting list that will be sorted after 3 recursive calls to mergesort?
        21, 1 will be the resulting first list.
    
    What is the resulting list that will be osrted after 16 recursive calls to mergesort?
        43

    Which two lists would be merged on the 7th merge?
    (34, 43), (40, 46)

2. Understanding quicksort
    1) Suppose you are debugging a quicksort implementation that is supposed to sort an array in ascending order. After the first partition step has been completed, the contents of the array is in the following order: 3 9 1 14 17 24 22 20. Which of the following statements is correct about the partition step? Explain your answer.

    The pivot could have been 17 but could not have been 14, if the pivot were 14, the right array would've reached 17 and 14 would be where the 17 is.  So 17 is a possible solution to the first pivot.

    2) Given the following list of numbers 14, 17, 13, 15, 19, 10, 3, 16, 9, 12 show the resulting list after the second partitioning according to the quicksort algorithm.

        The list is: 9, 3, 10, 12, 19, 13, 16, 17, 15 when using the last item on the list as a pivot for the first partition.
        Second partition: 3, 9, 10, 12, 19, 13, 16, 17, 15.

        The list is: 12, 17, 13, 15, 19, 10, 3, 16, 9 when using the first item on the list as a pivot
